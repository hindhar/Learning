**Overview**

This Python script is designed to help solve the New York Times Spelling Bee puzzle. Given a central letter and six other letters, it finds all valid words and panagrams (words that use all provided letters) from the English language. The script leverages the NLTK library's words corpus to identify possible solutions.
